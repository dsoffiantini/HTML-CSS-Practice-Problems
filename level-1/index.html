                    You're reading me like erotica, boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah. I can't sleep let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back. I know there will be sacrifice but that's the price. All my girls vintage Chanel baby. What's up your sleeve, such a tease. Heard it's beautiful, be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote. Please fasten your seat belts and make sure your champagne glasses are empty. Who am I living for?. Sipping on Rosé, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy. So we hit the boulevard.

You brought me to life, now every February you'll be my Valentine, Valentine. I'll be your gift, give you something good to celebrate. Yeah, she dances to her own beat. Big hoops, and maroon lips, my clique hoppin' in my Maserati. Woo! Pop your confetti.

Oh no, did I get too close? Like a bird without a cage. The boys break their necks try'na to creep a little sneak peek. You’re gonna hear me roar. Can't be your savior, I don't have the power. I should've told you what you meant to me 'Cause now I pay the price. All this money can't buy me a time machine. I'm walking on air (tonight). It's like she walked right out of your dreams. So we hit the boulevard.

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock? Respect. Make 'em go, 'Aah, aah, aah' as you shoot across the sky-y-y! Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy. Scared to rock the boat and make a mess. Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me. What you're hidin' underneath. Yeah, she dances to her own beat. The boys break their necks try'na to creep a little sneak peek. Oh oh!
